# NukemNet Plus
# A extension by THEBaratusII for aaBlueDragon's NukemNet
Extension for NukemNet (Mainly adds support for more games)

WHAT DOES IT DO?
* Adds support for games & source ports originally not on NukemNet's supported games list (May potentially be added in a future NukemNet update)
* Adds the ability to load usermaps for certain games (Not implemented but planned!)
* More to be added or considered in the future...

Huge thanks to aaBlueDragon (Developer of NukemNet) for guiding me how to work with the extensions.
